- What are your initial impressions of how `Inheritance` affects your programming?

It made my code a lot more clear since I wasn't repeating myself. I also liked how it helped to organize things in a hierarchy which helped me understand the entire problem better.

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

Worked: Consider all possible errors that could happen when writing methods and have cases to handle them (e.g. trying to check a book out could cause errors if the book isn't there, the book is already checked out, etc)

Didn't Work: I didnt use "this" when refering to different variables with the same names in certain methods which made my code confusing and wrong.

Advice: Searching through the documentation for helpful methods (like for Hashtable!) can make your life a lot easier and your code simpler
